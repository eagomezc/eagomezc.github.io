  Hi, my name is Esteban. I'm PhD in science research with expertise in bioinformatics and machine learning applied to immunology, genomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Experienced in developing predictive tools for health research, analyzing large-scale biological data, and working with programming languages like Python, R and Bash. My strong background in both bioinformatics and lab techniques helps me to bridging multidisciplinary teams to solve complex problems.
